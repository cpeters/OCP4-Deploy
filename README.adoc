== Workflow

=== To deploy OCP4.x

. Update variables in the install-config.yaml file
.. baseDomain is the top level route53 domain
.. metadata.Name is cluster name
.. region might need to be updated
. Ensure GitHub Secrets are created and up-to-date
.. CLUSTER_ADMIN is the cluster admin username
..  ADMIN_PASS is cluster admin password
..  DEV_PASS is the password for andrew the developer
.. PULL_SECRET is the required Red Hat creds for their repositories
.. AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID is the AWS Access Key
.. AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY is the AWS Secret Access key
. Create PR to merge deploy.md to main after adding name and date to list

NOTE: You can now check the Actions to watch/check the status of the deployment.  Also, the latest stable version of OpenShift 4 will be deployed.  This can be updated or changed in the workflow deploy file.

==== Actions

Upon successful merge to main of deploy.md file, the workflow will automatically kick off.

. Perform AWS IPI 
. Creates an Artifact for Destroy
.. You can download artifact if needed from GitHub Actions > Runs
.. Double check your retention period for Artifacts
. Setup HTPasswd IDP
.. Uses CLUSTER_ADMIN and ADMIN_PASS
.. Uses DEV_PASS for andrew the developer
. Install GitOps Operator
.. Sets admin password for console to ADMIN_PASS

==== Important

* During the *deploy* workflow the artifacts describing the AWS resources that are deployed are needed for the *destroy* workflow.  
* The artifacts are uploaded for only 90 days and will need to be *manually* downloaded if it's not planned to *destroy* the cluster within that retention period.

=== To destroy OCP4.x

. Push or Merge change to destroy.md

This will kick off the destroy workflow, pulling the artifact from deploy workflow automatically and destroying the AWS resources.





== TODO

* Add OCP openshift-installer version as variable




NOTE: GitHub IDP is disabled currently

=== GitHub IDP

* GitHub IDP is used in this deploy, so a GitHub organization should be created
* Add the clientSecret to GitHub Secrets as CLIENT_SECRET
* Update the GitHub Organization name and clientID in idp-oauth.yaml file
